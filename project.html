            <h2 class="open-h2">What is bullying?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="open-t1">
                 Bullying is a big problem that happens a lot. It's not just about hitting or pushing it's
                also name-calling, spreading rumors, or being mean online. This article is all about understanding bullying
                better, looking at the different parts that make it happen.</p>

            <h2 class="open-h2">What is ment by intimidasion:</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="open-t1">
            Bullying isn't just one thing it's when someone keeps doing things to hurt or upset
            another person. It can be words, actions, or online stuff. To really get it, we need to see how it all fits
            together.

        <div class="open-h2">
            <h2 class="open-h2">It starts with Being Mean:</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="open-t1">Bullying usually begins when someone starts being mean. They might say hurtful things,
                spread rumors, or even get physical. They do it for different reasons  wanting control, power, or maybe
                just getting back at someone.</p>

            <h2 class="open-h2">Gets Worse with Power Struggles:</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="open-t1">As bullying goes on, the person being mean gets more control, and the other person feels
                less powerful. This power difference becomes a big part of bullying. The mean actions get worse, making
                the person being bullied feel smaller and less important.</p>

        <div class="open-h2">
            <h2 class="open-h2">Hurts the Person Being Bullied:</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="open-t1">Bullying really hurts the person it's happening to. It messes with their feelings,
                thoughts, and sometimes even their body. They might feel alone, sad, or scared. The mean things said or
                done make them doubt themselves.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="open-h2">
            <h2 class="open-h2">Others Join In, Making It Worse:</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="open-t1">Bullying doesn't happen in a vacuum. Other people might join in, or even if they don't,
                they might not stop it. This makes the bullying stronger. Sometimes, people are afraid they'll be the
                next target, so they stay quiet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="open-h2">
            <h2 class="open-h2">Stopping Bullying Takes Everyone:</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="open-t1">To stop bullying, we all need to do something. Teachers, parents, and everyone around
                need to step in and stop it. Schools and communities can create a kind atmosphere and make sure everyone
                talks openly. It's not just about stopping it when it happens it's about making sure it doesn't start
                in the first place.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="open-h2">
            <h2 class="open-h2">Conclusion:</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="open-t1">Bullying is a big problem, but we can do something about it. By understanding how it
                works and taking action, we can make sure our schools and communities are kind places where everyone
                feels safe. It's not just about stopping bullying when it happens it's about making sure it never
                starts.</p>
